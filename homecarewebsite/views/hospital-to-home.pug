    p
      | We are faced with many new and unexpected obstacles as seniors return home from a hospital stay.
      | It can be hard to understand medications or handle new medicines if we struggle to read fine print.
      | Even if they struggle from memory problems, their wellbeing relies on recalling and meeting discharged orders when
      | creating and holding doctor&nbsp;visits for follow-up. It can also be a challenge to get the physical help and assistance
      | they need while they heal. Is it any surprise that almost one-fifth of seniors were re-hospitalized within 30 days of
      | being released from the hospital, usually with a different condition from that for which they were first admitted?
    p
      | The great news is that at a time when people leave the hospital sicker and quicker than ever before,
      | SYNERGY HomeCare can provide the support your senior loved one needs to fully recover.

            | Did you know that within one month of discharge, 20 percent of Medicare patients are readmitted to a hospital? Address this as follows:
            ul.hth-list
              li.mb-2.mt-2
                | Within a month of discharge, one in five Medicare patients end up in the hospital, a practice costing billions of dollars a year.
              li.mb-2
                | Eric Coleman MD, Colorado University in Denver, said patients often have a honeymoon idea of how things will be when they&apos;re back. Then they go back to the hospital when they get confused about how to handle their medication or run into other issues-they don&apos;t know where else to go.
              li.mb-2
                | A research in the New England Journal of Medicine April 2009 showed that within a month of discharge, about 20 percent of 11.9 million patients were readmitted to the hospital-about a third were back in the hospital within three months. Unexpected recurrent trips of the $102.6 billion Medicare paying hospitals in 2004 were valued at $17.4 billion. &quot;It&apos;s a big hunk of money and it&apos;s a big hunk of misery,&quot; said study co-author, Dr. Stephen Jencks.
              li.mb-2
                | Readmissions from hospitals and their expenses are now attracting even more scrutiny because the budget of President Barack Obama calls for a decrease in Medicare readmissions spending to help pay for health care reform.
              li.mb-2
                | In 2008 the Gerontological Society of America published a separate study representing almost 3 million community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries:
                ul.hth-list.ml-4
                  li.mb-2.mt-2
                    | Individuals living alone had a 50% rise in early readmission chances (within 60 days) relative to those who did not live alone.
                  li.mb-2
                    | Individuals reporting any unmet functional need had 48 percent higher early readmission chances compared to those with no unmet IADL needs.
                  li.mb-2
                    | Individuals lacking self-management skills had an improvement in early readmission chances of 44 percent relative to those lacking self-management skills.
                  li.mb-2
                    | A statistically relevant correlation with early readmission was not shown by financial income.

            | When your elderly parent heals from orthopedic surgery &mdash; whether it&apos;s hip implants or a new knee, hip or elbow procedure &mdash; it&apos;s vital that they obey their doctor&apos;s recovery instructions carefully. To prevent prolonged weakness or even loss of function, the drills for strength and range of motion must be performed on the prescribed schedule.

            | A hospital stay can take a major impact on the health of elderly people, whether due to sickness, injury or surgery. Seniors are especially prone to fall and relapse after a hospital discharge. We can potentially re-injure themselves by lifting or making a sudden move. We may not eat well enough for a complete recovery, sometimes feeling too frail to prepare their own meals. Here are some valuable tools to ensure a complete recovery at home for your loved one:
            ul.hth-list
              li.mb-2.mt-2
                | Nutrition Resources: Special dietary needs can be managed through strict shopping guidelines and proper food preparation for conditions such as diabetes, hypertension or heart disease.  Proper nutrition in the recovery process will help. Your caregiver will prepare food to fuel your recovery in accordance with your exact nutritional needs.
              li.mb-2
                | Logistical Resources: Recovery also includes doctor or professional follow-up visits. SYNERGY HomeCare can help in the planning, preparation and fulfillment of clinical and counseling appointments for follow-up. With your consent, your caregiver can attend doctor&apos;s appointments and take notes to make it home and be followed by instructions.
              li.mb-2
                | Medication Resources: Medication is often needed to recover from a disease or surgery. SYNERGY HomeCare will assist with reminders of medication so that medicine is taken as instructed on time. Your caregiver can, of course, drop off and collect prescriptions as needed at your local pharmacy.
