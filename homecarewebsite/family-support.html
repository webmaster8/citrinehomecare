                    <p>While it is a labor of love to care for your elderly parent, it is still labor. 
                        You may find yourself giving up favorite hobbies and holidays as you spend more and more of your time caring for your 
                        senior parent, saying no to friends, feeling disturbed at work and getting more stressed with your spouse and children. 
                        Juggling treatment with jobs, raising children, and running a household over time increases your risk of depression, 
                        chronic disease, and a decrease in overall quality of life. </p>

                    <p>Given these dangers, if you're like most caregivers, you can lack good health habits. You can skimp on sleep, 
                        eat poorly, miss regular exercise, go on even if you're sick and cancel your own medical appointments. 
                        You are more likely to suffer from a chronic condition such as high cholesterol and high blood pressure and be 
                        overweight if you are a caregiver who neglects your own safety. Caregiving can also have a negative impact on your 
                        mental health, with an estimated 46% to 59% of caregivers suffering from clinical depression.</p>

                    <p>It's time to stop and tell yourself: "What benefit will I be if I become sick to the person I care about?" 
                        As a caregiver, taking good care of yourself is important to you — even while you're taking care of your loved one 
                        of aging.</p>

                    <p>It is acceptable to take a much-needed time to meet your elderly parent's needs through the respite care services 
                        provided by SYNERGY HomeCare.</p>

                <p>When they least expect it, adult children can be forced into the caregiver position. 
                    It only takes the sickness of an elderly parent, a slip in the restroom, or a collision triggered by a driver's 
                    seat mistake, and an adult child may find their current job as a caregiver — a role for which few people plan or 
                    prepare adequately. For practical tips and advice on care, please read online or download a few handy resources below:</p>
